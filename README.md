### About me

I am a 24 year old boy from Norway, who decided to take a year abroad to experience the strange and exotic Canadian culture. Soon after arrival I started to notice the huge differences between Canada and my motherland:
* In Canada people speak English, while in Norway we speak Norwegian
* Canada is located in North-America, Norway is in Europe
* The two countries are different sizes
	* Canada is bigger!

Apart from spotting differences, I enjoy skiing and climbing (which, I have to admit, did influence my choice of applying to UBC). To showcase my markdown skills, and also keeping up with the "about me" topic, here is a list of likes and dislikes:

Likes | Dislikes
----------|----------
Friends | Enemies
Old Kanye | A lot of Kanyes opinions
Backflips | Broken necks
Python 3.7 | Not snow on Christmas
Beer | Being hangover

Now, let me show you this picture of me, while at the same time demonstrating both *italic* AND **bold**:
