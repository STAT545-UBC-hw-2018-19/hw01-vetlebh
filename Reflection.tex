REFLECTION

Firstly I pulled my repository from git to local storage. For editing of the files, everything was done locally, and saved, commited and pushed to my repository. I used RStudio for editing the Rmd file, and TeXShop for md and tex files. For git handling I use the terminal, which is working great. I did not face any problems, all the programs and systems are working correctly it seems. I used the Git Flavoured Markdown cheat-sheet and example README posted by Vincenzo for editing the README.md, and the internal RStudio-help for any questions I had about the R functions.
